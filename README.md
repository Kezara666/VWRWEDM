A game that controls real-world lights using Arduino and IoT technology. When something happens in the game, it triggers a response in the real world.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, download the project files from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gCyDzG0gnV8oXJJ6I4pnwzAONKNMf7Jh) (12GB) and unzip the files. Make sure to keep the `main.py`, `main2.py`, `a.bat`, `b.bat`, and `light_off.cs` files in the installation folder.

### ⚙️ Installation

1. Install Unity 2021.3.19
2. Open the project in Unity
3. Build and Run the project on your device

### 🔧 Arduino and IoT Setup

1. Connect the HC-06 Bluetooth module to the Arduino board
2. Upload the `arduino.ino` sketch to the Arduino board
3. Connect the lights to the Arduino board
4. Make sure the lights are working properly
5. When the Arduino receives a `1` from the laptop, the lights turn on. When it receives a `0`, the lights turn off.

### 🕹️ Playing the Game

1. Launch the game on your device
2. Follow the instructions in the game to play
3. When you perform a certain action in the game, it will trigger a response in the real world
